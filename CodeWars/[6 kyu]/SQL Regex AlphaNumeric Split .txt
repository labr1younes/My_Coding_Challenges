/* The Oracle/PLSQL REGEXP_REPLACE function is an extension of the function REPLACE.
This function, introduced in Oracle 10g, allows you to replace a sequence of characters 
in a string with a different set of characters using regular expression pattern mapping.

[ ] It is used to specify a list of matches 
where you try to match any of the characters in the list.

[^ ]  It is used to specify a nonmatching list where you try to match 
any character except for those on the list.

\d  Corresponds to the digital symbol.
